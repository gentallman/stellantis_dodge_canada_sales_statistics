2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Clean the scraped data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Transform the data to facilitate merging by standardizing the format and structure.
   - Merge the sales data for the five models based on monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales figures.

3. **Creating a Power BI Report with Data Modeling**:
   - Import the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI.
   - Establish relationships between the three tables (monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales) in Power BI.
   - Use Power Query Editor to further refine and shape the data as needed.
   - Create a visually appealing report in Power BI, utilizing various visuals, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and other Power BI features to present the data effectively.
